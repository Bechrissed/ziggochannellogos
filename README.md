Ziggo Channel Logo's for XBMC 12 Frodo
======================================

I created a list of dutch channel logo's wich can be used in combination with Ziggo TV standard.
Let me know if there is interest in missing logo's for TV plus and TV extra.


Howto
=====

In XBMC go to:

  System > Live TV > Menu/OSD

Add the default folder for PVR thumbnails.
That's all, enjoy!
